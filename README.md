# game_card_generation
generates image files for cards for games based on a data file containing attributes of the cards

This project is intended to help simplify game development by promoting organization of card data as well as generation of new cards.

Hopefully, this will assist in the ability to more quickly make changes during the playtesting phase of development.

The code currently is customized to a specific game, but can be easily adjusted to fit others.
Reach out with any questions about getting the code to work.

Will hopefully create a more generalized tool requiring less manual change for each game at some point.
